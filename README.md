# Pyspark-demo
In this repository I will demonstrate how pyspark can be used to do data wrangling, plot insights using pandas, matplotlib.

The repository has 1 folder one that contains the part where I perform Data wrangling to generate insights and visualize them using Pandas and matplotlib. 
I used the 2.4.3 version of Spark in undertake all tasks mentioned above.

The data I used can be downloaded here https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/

The data is about ratings a movie received by a user as well information about a movie's cast and crew, genre etc.
