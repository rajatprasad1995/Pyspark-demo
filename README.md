# Pyspark-demo
In this repository I will demonstrate how pyspark can be used to do data wrangling, plot insights using pandas, plotly.

The folder "Data Wrangling"  contains couple of jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) where I use spark to wrangle data and use plotly, Pandas to generate insights. 

I used the 2.4.3 version of Spark in undertake all tasks mentioned above.

The data I used can be downloaded here https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/

The data is about ratings a movie received by a user as well information about a movie's cast and crew, genre etc.
