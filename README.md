# Pyspark-demo
In this repository I will demonstrate how pyspark can be used to do data wrangling, plot insights using pandas, matplotlib and train a simple decision tree classifier.

The repository has 2 folders one that contains the part where I perform Data wrangling to generate insights and visualize them using Pandas and matplotlib. The other folder contains a jupyter notebook where I train a simple decision tree classifier. 

I used the 2.4.3 version of Spark in undertake all tasks mentioned above.
